I took the idea of Omegle and added social media features such as friends, direct messages, custom profiles, and group servers.

## DDD

I used this project to utilise a new architecture I had been learning called Domain Driven Design (DDD), which separates business logic from its implementation.

### Note

I left Trist in an incomplete state, however the features that have been implemented still work.
