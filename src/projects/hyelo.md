A minimal chat application.

## Features

- Chat with a random user based on chosen tags.
- Create a room and invite others to join.
- A selection of premade rooms to publicly access.
- A minimal UI with multiple colour palletes.

## No More React (Yay)

After making many ReactJs apps, I wanted to try make something with as little bloat as possible which is why Hyelo is made in pure JavaScript and HTML.
